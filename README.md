# gap-com
General regularization selection method for undirected graphical models based on gap statistic.

# Install package

I used RStudio (version 1.1.453) and Microsoft R Open (version 3.5.1.) to create this package.

Unzip the "gapcom.zip" file into a working directory and run the following lines:

```r
library(devtools)
library(roxygen2)

install("gapcom")
```

# Example

# Reference

Gap-com statistic is described in:

Kuismin and Sillanpaa (manuscript) "Gap-com: General model selection method for sparse undirected networks with clustering structure".

File "CodeCollection.zip" is a collection of scripts used to prepare the material in this paper. You can also find the older R implementation of gap-com in the zip file.
